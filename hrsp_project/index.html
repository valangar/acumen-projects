					Acumen, LLC's clients assign a risk score rank to various physicians in the nation, which helps determine the physician of interest. The tool provides a visual representation of these ranks and a geographic understanding of the physicians' location.
					<br>
					<br>
					This standalone visualization tool was my first end-to-end contribution. I was involved in:
					<br>
					<ul>
						<li>gathering requirements from the client,</li>
						<li>determining the user work flow, </li>
						<li>designing the user interface, </li>
						<li>implementing the application, </li>
						<li>incorporating feedback, making changes to UI, updating features</li>
						<li>debugging, checking for cross-browser compatibility - mainly Chrome and IE browsers</li>
						<li>documenting code, creating user guides</li>
					</ul>
					The first iteration of the application took one month to implement, followed by the feedback phase.
					
					<div class="tech-used">Technologies used: </div>
					<ul>
						<li>JavaScript - JQuery</li>
						<li>D3.js for the map visualization and interactions</li>
						<li>DataTable library for table view port</li>
						<li>require.js to include libraries, modules</li>
						<li>Bootstrap for the tutorial</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>

				The final tool with the map view looks like this:
				<div class = "img" id = "hrsp" ></div>
				It contains two views:
				<ul>
					<li>Map View - default view</li>
					<li>Table View - containing controls to toggle the table columns</li>
				</ul>
				The table shows up in both the views.
				The Map View has two functionalities:
				<ul>
					<li> Provide a visual representation of ranks of regions based on various metrics</li>
					<li>Act as a controller to filter the table of physician information.</li>
				</ul>
				The Table metrics view has a list of all the columns in the table and can be used to toggle the visibility of these columns. 
				All the columns highlighted in blue are visible in the table.
				Users can also toggle visibility of a group of columns.
				<div class = "img" id = "hrsp-table-metrics" ></div>
				I implemented mousewheel map zooming and translation for a smooth interactive experience for users. 
				Users can zoom into the map to view the judicial districts and the counties.
				<div class = "img" id = "hrsp-jd" ></div>
				<div class = "img" id = "hrsp-county" ></div>
				Clicking on a state, judicial district or county filters the table for the clicked region.
				<div class = "img" id = "hrsp-county-filtered" ></div>
				If the user wants to check the location of the physician, they can click on the physician row on the table to add a yellow marker on the map which indicates the actual geographic location of the selected physician.
				<div class = "img" id = "hrsp-county-zoom" ></div>
				An example of using bootstrap tutorial for user reference.
